## Genome-scale metabolic reconstruction (GEM) of *Chlorella ohadii*

Here, we present a fully automated platform for the *de novo* generation of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). We deployed this platform to reconstruct the GEM and the enzyme-constrained GEM for *C. ohadii*.

### Contents
Here, the project's directory structure is illustrated: 
```
c_ohadii_GEM
├── code
│   ├── functions
│   └── examples.m
├── data
├── models
```
The ```code/``` folder contains the implementation of the main functions, located in the ```functions/``` directory and the ```example.m``` file provides examples of how to use these functions. The ```model/``` directory includes the final conventional and enzyme-constrained GEMs under four different growth conditions, available in both MATLAB and SBML formats. The ```data/``` folder contains the data, used or generated in the project.
